Gradient Animation Experimentation

I've tried animating gradient backgrounds in CSS only to be disappointed.  So, I wanted to see if I could figure out how to do it in Javascript, and the results are awesome.  With enough time and effort, some really amazing effects could be manufactured this way.  And if you stare at the animation for more than ten or twenty seconds, you can really get lost in them, hypnotized, moved into an altered-state of consciousness, and sans chemicals, which is at least neat and safe if not exactly cool.
